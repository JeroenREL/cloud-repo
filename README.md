This is a program that calculates the score for a bowling game.  Fill in the correct score for each turn.  After 10 frames, the total score will be calculated.

Functionality is not complete, functionality description is as follows:
- turns with scores from 0 to 9 pins are calculated correctly
- if a spare is scored, that functionality works fine except for the last (10th) frame
- if a strike is scored for a given frame, there will be no second turn for that frame (which is as should be), but score calculation is not OK.  Also strike functionality is not working fine for 10th and last frame
